# charttone-bass

A library for a sampled bass-guitar in overtone.

This was made during a hackweek project at Chartbeat. A group of us wanted to play with overtone because we love music and we love clojure (or at least wanted to get more experience with clojure...). Overtone is a great library for exploring both.

I was playing with the jazz sample project in overtone and was extremely disappointed in how horrible the bass lines sounded while the drums were so awesome. I found the other sampled instruments in the overtone library and decided to find a good sampled bass guitar. These samples are recorded mezzo-forte and I think are great. It can also be used as a template for adding other intstrument samples, and in fact, I should probably make a macro for it :) the hardest part is finding the samples and sed/awk/sh foo to make a list of the freesound sample ids.
